# VFSS Segmentation Benchmark

This repository is dedicated to benchmarking diverse models for the task of Semantic Segmentation in Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Studies (VFSS). The goal is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of various models, including both traditional and state-of-the-art approaches, to identify the most effective techniques for this specific application.

## Dataset
The datasets used for benchmarking consists of both publicly available and private datasets of VFSS images, annotated for semantic segmentation tasks. 

## Models Evaluated
- U-Net
- TransUNet

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU)
- Dice Score
